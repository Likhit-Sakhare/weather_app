## **Libraries Used**
1. **Kotlin**: First-class and official programming language for Android development.
2. **Jetpack compose**: A toolkit for building Android apps that uses a declarative API to simplify and speed up UI development
3. **Retrofit**: It is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java that simplifies making network requests to RESTful APIs by converting API responses into Kotlin or Java objects.
4. **Material Components for Android**: For modular and customizable Material Design UI components.
5. **Coil**: It is a modern, lightweight image-loading library for Android that supports caching and integrates seamlessly with Jetpack Compose.

## Lessons Learned

While building this app, I learned about:

- **APIs and Retrofit**: How to create a Retrofit instance, use the GET function, handle API keys and their parameters, and fetch data (e.g., weather data for a specific city).
- **Handling Network States**: The importance of a helper class (e.g., NetworkResponse) to manage network states effectively. By defining Success, Error, and Loading states, I streamlined the process of handling errors, displaying loading indicators, and processing successful responses.
